# Rez (Installer)

Install `rez` package as is from 
[official GitHub releases](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/releases) as the
`rez_install` package.

This is to avoid confusion between the `rez` package generated by `rez-bind`.

1. `git clone` this package.
2. Update the version number in `package.py`
3. `rez build --install --clean`
4. Check the local `rez_install` package is all good
4. Commit and push to `master` branch (let GitLab CI release it)
